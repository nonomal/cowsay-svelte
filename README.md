# cowsay-svelte

![Cow says hello](./public/cowsayshello.png)

This is a GUI for the famous `cowsay` program loved by many programmers. Here's the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) if you want to know more about cowsay. This website lets you generate these cowsay images in different color schemes.

I created this website just to get my mind off some other big projects. Also to be able to create these cowsay images myself to send to my friends.

## Todo

I made this small project over two years ago. TypeScript has evolved since then. So this project has a bunch of type issues I haven't gotten around to fix yet.

Also, the components aren't laid out as well as I would like.
